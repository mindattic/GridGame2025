We ate through the world like acid. 

Seeping into the Undearth, trickling ever downward, 
consuming all before us—never sated, never still.

Until we met resistance. Dwellers in the dark. 
A people who had never known war, never known light. 

We were interlopers. Invaders from above. 
A light bearing race corrupting everything in our wake.

A poison seeping into cavernous cathedrals, 
corrupting them into corroded hollows with 
the light that followed us down into exile.
